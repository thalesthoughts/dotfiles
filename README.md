# Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles I currently use for my day-to-day workflow as a student and researcher, with a focus on scientific computing and data science. I’ll continue updating this repository as I discover new ways to improve my workflow. While these tools are tailored to my needs, I hope you find something useful here as well!
